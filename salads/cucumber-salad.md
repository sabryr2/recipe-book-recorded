# Cucumber salad

## Ingredients
  - Greens: A large handful of your favorite lettuce (Romaine, Butter lettuce, or a bag of pre-washed mixed greens work perfectly).
  - 1/4 English cucumber (or a handful of mini cucumbers), sliced or chopped.
  - 1 small tomato, chopped, or a handful of cherry tomatoes, halved.
  - A few slices of red onion (optional).

## Instructions
  - Wash and Dry: If your greens aren't pre-washed, rinse them and dry them well
    in a salad spinner or with a clean towel. Wet greens will make your dressing watery. 
  - Chop: Tear or chop the greens into bite-sized pieces and place them in a bowl.
    Add the chopped cucumber, tomato, and onion.
  - Mix
